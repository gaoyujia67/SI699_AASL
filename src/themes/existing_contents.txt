'Not at this time.',
'Ditch the "Foundations" and "Domains." ',
'We need to be able to have concrete standards to give to our administrators. When the Superintendent says "you are now teaching Science" I need to be able to say "here is my curriculum- when will I be able to get this done if I am teaching science?". As of now, telling them that I need to curate, think, grow, etc. is not helpful. ',
"I'm not sure what to ask for, I guess I just wish it was somehow simpler to use and talk about with others. I think jargon is always off-putting.",
'Nothing new!!! In fact, our standards should be streamlined.',
'It can be manipulated to make libraries into STEM centers instead of information literacy (throwing out the humanities -literature- part of the library)',
'Better, measurable standards that measure content, understanding and practices students need to be successful researchers. ',
'a total revision and simplification of standards',
'I think that rather than adding, perhaps rethinking the standards in a more inclusive way.',
'I think it needs a complete overhaul to make it worthwhile to use in the classroom, especially at the early levels.',
'I just wish our standards could be easier to understand.',
'Actual skills and when they should be achieved.',
'The overall idea is ok itâ€™s just so much. Simplify them. ',
'Please work to return the standards to a more concise, practical format that can easily be read, understood, implemented, and shared when advocating for the library.',
'No, it is both thorough and thoughtfully developed. My only limitation in using it is the time to process and consider the standards regularly.',
'Clarifying the domains and the standards',
'They need to be shorter and easier to use.  ',
'I think it should sound like it was written by humans who are in diverse schools and places. I think it should focus more on skills and less on lofty goals.',
