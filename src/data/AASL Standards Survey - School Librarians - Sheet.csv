They need to be streamlined into categories way more than they are and given practicality rather than theory. They encompass what students should be doing at all grade levels but are not broken down into any sort of idea when the students should be doing them. I teach Kindergarten and 1st grade. So much of it is too much for students or there is no way you could teach it all in a year seeing them once a week. It could be worse in a flexible schedule when you don't see them as often.  It's important for our learners to develop their curiosities and own inquiries. I completely agree with this. It should not be the only thing and there is a way to scaffold it as the students get older.  When your standards are so vast they can't even fit on one-two pages there is a gigantic problem. They are more wordy and confusing than Common Core when those teachers have way more time to teach their students. I don't think these standards are best serving us at all.,5,4,Does not describe at all,4,Does not describe at all,Does not describe at all,5,5,Does not describe at all,5,"I like that you do emphasize that the library is a place for exploration and to encourage student interests. After the standards were made, I do place more emphasis on students exploring different topics of their own interest. ","The learning standards are too much as a whole and are not clear the way they are presented. It would be better if there were less standards, aligned by grade level with a broader focus. Then a book detailing them could go further in detail with practical ideas and activities. More infographics, more charts more visual rather than the wordy dry version that focuses on one aspect of library. For example the Curate Standard Think and Create start to overlap. Determining the need, identifying possible sources of information, making critical choices, seeking a variety of sources  etc... (This is all done in the Research Process with the Super 3 and Big 6). Why are we taking something simple with 3-6 steps and making it so complicated across the board. It's also a lot for an adult to take in much less to teach to a student. Time is valuable and you have to be picky about what you teach. You can teach all these things in K-12 but scaffold it throughout the grade levels instead of the way it is presented in this format.    I've been teaching Library classes for 15 years, and it is sad that some people just want to change what is we do and our standards without communicating with more Librarians in the field. In my library it is my job to teach students to find information, research skills, but also to learn about authors and the parts of a book and website. We teach those skills by collaborating with teachers in content areas. We are now including the Engineering Design Process and STEM in our curriculum. The standards should reflect this.

I do not have time to plan new standard based lessons or update my library with resources that are aligned and support the new standards.
