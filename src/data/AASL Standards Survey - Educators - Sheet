A universal planning tool/lesson plan template that includes: enduring understandings, essential questions, objectives, learning targets, assessment, learning plan, resources, academic language, differentiation, specific strategies for special education students & English langauge learners and effective teaching strategies. School librarians need curated lists of enduring understandings connected to essential questions. They also need examples of how to translate objectives into student friendly language (Learning Targets expressed from the students point of view as ""I can"" statements). We need a list of academic language (library specific vocabulary taught in the lesson). Examples of effective teaching strategies (e.g. Marzano) and connections to either Bloom's taxonomy or Webb's Depth of Knowledge.

Standards can't be implemented if they can't be access.  The cost is a huge barrier to that access.  The group that has implemented are the tried and true that are active and involved in the field, have a library supervisor who purchased them for them, or have recently completed their program.  There are probably many school librarians who have no idea that they exist or if they do, the access to them has been set beyond what they can reach.  If you want to really want to stress implementation, you need to make them available to access for free (with support materials that could cost), work on a systematic system of trainings in each state, and demonstrate how AASL is working with school librarians instead of just trying to just look for ways to bring in funding.  I think there is a horrible perception out there for AASL and this needs to be really thought about carefully before any new standards are rolled out.",Not very well,"You need to come and talk with the ESLS group and the university professors.  There would be tons of ways you could create modules, lesson, webinars, etc. that would help support future educators.  There were many many many missed opportunities with the standards.  It was a shame.

If you look at all the other major standards revisions (every 10 years) they have made major and substantial changes to the standards -- therefore at least somewhat justify the need to buy new things.  I have great fears that AASL is going to try and just tweak these a bit and what will happen is a PR nightmare where it looks like AASL is just trying to make money.  Don't get me wrong -- I know the association needs supported and needs funding, but this way I fear is going to backfire and cause a great deal of angst in the field and profession towards AASL.  So, please think carefully as you revise and think carefully about how you are going to share these and provide access to the field.  There is a lot riding on doing this right."
