    "#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning was more complex than anticipated, primarily due to the survey's structure. Many questions allowed multiple selections or required respondents to rank choices, making the dataset format unconventional. Instead of a standard table with one row for field names and one column for record indexes, the dataset required reorganization. We expanded multi-choice responses into separate fields to facilitate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge was the extensive demographic and work experience data collected. While the survey provided a comprehensive view of respondents, not all categories were necessary for our analysis. To maintain clarity, we categorized school librarians by **\"Job Roles\"** rather than alternative classifiers like school levels (elementary, middle, high school) or school settings (public, private, charter). This decision aligned with our client’s priorities, as they were particularly interested in insights from librarians with specific job titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we performed the following tasks:\n",
    "- **Dropped irrelevant fields.**\n",
    "    The dataset contained 52 questions, some of which overlapped in content or were not directly relevant to our analysis. To streamline the dataset, we removed redundant or unrelated fields, ensuring a clearer structure.\n",
    "- **Renamed columns.**\n",
    "    Since the dataset was directly exported from a survey platform, field names were lengthy question texts, making them difficult to reference in code. We assigned concise, descriptive names to improve readability and usability.\n",
    "- **Reformatted the dataset to handle multi-answer questions**\n",
    "    A major challenge was handling \"select all that apply\" questions, where respondents could choose multiple answers. The original data structure made analysis difficult, so we reorganized these responses into a more structured format. After renaming the columns, we also removed the first row, which contained subtitles rather than actual data, to ensure consistency."
